# 🚦 TrafficFlowGame

A **Java-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project that simulates real-world traffic flow using polymorphic vehicle classes, geometric logic, and modular design principles. Built to demonstrate clean class hierarchies, abstraction, and maintainable code structure.

---

## 💡 Overview

**TrafficFlowGame** is a simulation that models vehicles — including cars, trucks, and ambulances — moving within a traffic environment.  
The project emphasizes **software design principles** and **object-oriented architecture**, showcasing strong fundamentals in Java development such as:

- Inheritance and polymorphism  
- Interface-driven design  
- Abstraction and encapsulation  
- Code reusability and modularity  

This project serves as both an educational exercise and a demonstration of scalable OOP architecture.

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- 🧩 **OOP Architecture:** Implements inheritance hierarchies where all vehicle types extend from a base `TrafficElement` class.  
- 🔁 **Interface Implementation:** `Movable` interface defines consistent movement behavior across all objects.  
- 🏗️ **Abstraction & Encapsulation:** Abstract classes and private instance variables promote maintainable and extensible code.  
- 📏 **Geometric Modeling:** Provided `Point` and `Polygon` classes handle positional logic, aiding movement and collision checks.  
- 🚑 **Polymorphism in Action:** Multiple vehicle subclasses (Car, Truck, Ambulance) demonstrate runtime method overriding and behavior customization.
